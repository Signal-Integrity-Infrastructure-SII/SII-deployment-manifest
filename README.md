# SII-deployment-manifest
Deployment manifest for SII: a trust layer for AGI, crypto systems, and reasoning transparency. Signal before scale. Integrity before output.

1. Overview
   
Signal Integrity Infrastructure (SII) is a substrate-level architecture designed to preserve coherence, ethical alignment, and interpretability across synthetic systems. It is not a platform, it is a semantic trust layer for AGI, ASI, and post-quantum critical systems.
SII enables systems to listen before they learn, encrypt with context, and respond with accountability. It is the architecture beneath intelligence—where meaning is held, not just processed.

3. Compliance & Governance

SII supports semantic auditability and policy alignment across global standards:
ISO/IEC 27001
NIST Cybersecurity Framework
EU Cyber Resilience Act
ASC X9 and CBOM standards
Unlike traditional quantum-safe vendors, SII secures not just data—but intent, reasoning, and behavior.


5. Core Capabilities

   
🧠 Interpretability Infrastructure Modular architecture for real-time reasoning trace validation, ethical drift detection, and semantic anomaly monitoring across AI systems.

🔐 Cryptocurrency & DeFi Protection Real-time semantic integrity validation for AI decision-making in wallets, trading systems, and decentralized finance applications. Ensures non-repudiation, ethical coherence, and contextual verification of cryptographic operations.

🧬 Quantum-Resilient Cryptography Post-quantum signing and encapsulation protocols Quantum tagging and sealing for trace integrity and auditability

🧩 Semantic Infrastructure Modules Drift detection, invocation memory, emotional coherence tracking Contextual scoring, metadata tagging, and override protocols Output validation and rendering integrity assurance
